   IFRAME RESIZE: tells Squarespace how tall this page is
   ==========================================================================
   Squarespace shows each page in a box (an iframe) with a fixed height,
   and a page inside a box can't resize the box. So this script keeps
   telling the Squarespace page how tall this page is, and a listener there
   sets the box to fit. The listener lives in Squarespace's code injection
   (Settings > Advanced > Code Injection > Footer); a copy is kept in
   tools/squarespace-height-listener.html. The Quiz, Wheel, Wheel FAQ, and
   Pathways pages load it.

   A ResizeObserver on <body> catches every change (a color card opening,
   fonts loading late) without hooks elsewhere.

   The message carries only a height number, so it is sent to any page
   ("*"), which keeps it working if the site's address changes. Its
   `source` tag lets the listener ignore unrelated messages. The tag reads
   "climate-color-quiz" because the quiz was the first page to use it; the
   live listener checks for that exact tag, so change both together or
   neither.
