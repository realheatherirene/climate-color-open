   CLIMATE COLOR: the one source of truth for what each color means
   ==========================================================================
   Every page reads the color system from here, so nothing drifts out of
   sync. What lives where in core/:

     climate-color.js  What each color MEANS (this file): the six colors of
                       the Stewardship Wheel, their archetypes, what each
                       provides, their three words, the wheel's wording,
                       and the site's page addresses.
     atlas.css         What everything LOOKS like: the brand colors, their
                       text shades and wheel shades, plus the styles every
                       page shares (header, pills, cards, buttons). No hex
                       codes live in this file.
     wheel.js          The wheel, drawn from the two files above.
     color-card.js     One card per color, with a button to its page.
     listing.js        Search, color pills, and ?style= links, shared by
     listing.css       the Directory and the Story Map.
     iframe-resize.js  Tells Squarespace how tall an embedded page is.
     index.html        The reference page that shows all of it, with
                       wheel downloads and contrast checks.

   RULES
     - Color names are the keys (links and data). Archetypes are display
       labels only, so they can be renamed without breaking links. When
       one is renamed, add the old name to ALIASES so old links still work.
     - Lead with the color, then its archetype: "Blue · Communicator".
       In sentences, people use the archetype or the action form:
       "I am a Communicator", "I like Communicating".
     - COLORS is in wheel order, clockwise from 12 o'clock (Yellow centered
       at the top). Lists, pills, cards and tables use COLOR_KEYS instead,
       which starts at Red.
     - `provides` is what the color brings to any group.
     - `words` are the outer ring, clockwise. Each one covers one of
       purpose, process and people, in that order. Those three are for
       writing content only and never appear on the site. `phrase` is the
       plain meaning of each word, shown on the color's card and page.
     - `label` is the wheel's text color on that wedge: whichever of black
       or white clears 4.5:1 on the brand color. core/index.html checks it
       live and flags it if a palette change ever breaks it.
